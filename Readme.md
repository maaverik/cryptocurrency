# POC Cryptocurrency app

This is a basic proof-of-work blockchain and cryptocurrency application built using node, express and redis with a minimal UI build with react. Two instances of the app are live at <https://thawing-mountain-05200.herokuapp.com/> and <https://guarded-beyond-51860.herokuapp.com/> which can sync transactions with each other through their shared redis connection which acts as an event bus.
